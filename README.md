This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

## Resolving merge conflicts in VS Code

1. Open README.md in VS Code. Conflicts appear as blocks like:
    ```
    <<<<<<< HEAD
    (your local content)
    =======
    (remote content)
    >>>>>>> main
    ```
    VS Code shows action buttons above each block: Accept Current Change, Accept Incoming Change, Accept Both Changes, Compare Changes.

2. Choose an action for each block (usually "Accept Both Changes" or "Accept Incoming Change").

3. Clean the file so no conflict markers (<<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>>) remain and save (Ctrl+S / Cmd+S).

4. Stage, commit, and push:
    - Use Source Control UI: click + next to README.md, enter a commit message like "Resolve merge conflict in README", commit, then push.
    - Or use the terminal:
      ```bash
      git add README.md
      git commit -m "Resolve merge conflict in README"
      git push origin main
      ```

5. Confirm the remote branch has the updated file.

This README now includes project info and conflict-resolution steps for VS Code.
